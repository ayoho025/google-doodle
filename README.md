# My topic Google Doodle

50+ words about your Google Doodle.
I am making a google doodle that features a panda(s). I haven't made final plans for what the google doodle is going to be yet. It will either be a paraody of the lofi studying image or there will be animated pandas with a percent chance of there being an albino panda or a redish brown panda. I don't want to bite off more than I can chew with this project.
